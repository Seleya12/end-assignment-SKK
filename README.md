# üéµ Roads Untraveled Rhythm-Game

TechBasics I: Final Project by Seleya Koch

## Introduction

Music has always been a big part of my life that why I always try to find a way to connect things back to my favorite artists, in this case Linkin Park.  
I decided to integrate my favorite song, **‚ÄúRoads Untraveled,‚Äù** into this project, the idea to do that came right after I got some lyrics of this song tattooed while I viseted London (to see Linkin Park play Wembley) in june.

The game itself is really simple: keep the circle‚Äôs beat, press SPACE at the right moment, and score as many points as possible before the timer runs out.  
I chose to keep the project intentionally simple, because the semester was quite challenging for me so my focus was truly just to have a working end product.

## üéÆ How to Play

- Press **ENTER** to start the game  
- Press **SPACE** when the circle is big ‚Üí this gives you points  
- A round lasts **20 seconds**  
- Press **R** to restart after the game ends  
- The music starts automatically when you play  

## ‚ú® Features

- Pulsing circle that matches the rhythm  
- Scoring system for correct hits  
- Timer for each round  
- Simple visuals with a background music loop  
- Lightweight game ‚Äì runs on Python and pygame  

## üíª Reflection 

Looking back, I am honestly just happy this is done now. 
I struggled a lot throughout the semester, so my goal was simply to deliver something complete and playable. And that worked out (I guess), I somehow ended up with a finished game that feels quite personal to me since it includes one of my all time favourite songs. 

On **September 11**, I got some much needed support from my colleagues:  
- **T. Fleischer** built me a new loop and provided the correct BPM so that the circle pulses on beats 1 and 4.  
- **T. Cerny** helped me make sure that the sound is only playing while the game is actually running.  
In addition, I also used **AI support** to fix error messages and small coding issues along the way.  
Combining my own work, help from colleagues, and AI assistance made it possible to reach a stable final version.
